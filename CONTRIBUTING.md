## Pull Requests

This project uses [Gitflow Branching Model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Double check the develop branch and merged PRs to see if your issue has already been fixed but not released.
Your change, if accepted, would either be held briefly until another release or we would make a new release after it has been merged.
We tend to make a release after each "batch" of planned work.

We _do_ reserve the right to ask you to make changes and possibly reject your PR if it doesn't fit our mission of "helping ediscovery professionals do more with less".

In order to give your Pull Request the best chance at being accepted:

- Open an issue before you start work and give a brief description so we know what's coming and give feedback
- Open your PR against the develop branch of the main Milyli/RelativityScriptRunner repository
- Leave a pleasant summary in the PR description, as if you were chatting with a dev over coffee
- Update the [Deployment README](./Deployment/) with any additional build steps that might be needed

After your PR is open someone at Milyli will review it and provide feedback.
